- [ ] Sufficient key lengths for encryption algorithms
- [x] Secure random number generation used
- [ ] No custom cryptographic implementations

## Detailed Findings

### Finding 1: Insufficient Password Reset Security
**Location:** `auth/reset.py:45-60`
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The password reset function does not verify the user's identity beyond email access. It lacks additional security questions or verification steps.
**Recommendation:** Implement a secondary verification method such as security questions or temporary one-time codes.

### Finding 2: SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Location:** `auth/login.py:28-35`
**Severity:** Critical
**Description:** User input is concatenated directly into SQL queries without proper parameterization. Example: `query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"`
**Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries or an ORM that handles SQL escaping automatically.

### Finding 3: Missing Rate Limiting on Login Attempts
**Location:** `auth/login.py:40-55`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** While account lockout is implemented after 5 failed attempts, there's no rate limiting to prevent rapid attempts, allowing attackers to try multiple accounts quickly.
**Recommendation:** Implement IP-based rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks across multiple accounts.

## Risk Assessment
Overall security posture: **Medium Risk**

The authentication system implements several important security controls but has significant gaps that could be exploited by attackers. The SQL injection vulnerability represents an immediate critical risk that should be addressed before deployment.
