# Performance Metrics Guide

This guide explains the performance metrics available in the Code Review Assistant and how to interpret and use them.

## Available Metrics

The performance analysis module provides the following categories of metrics:

### 1. Complexity Metrics

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code.
  - *Interpretation*: Higher values indicate more complex code that's harder to understand and test.
  - *Thresholds*: 1-5 (good), 6-10 (moderate), 11-15 (concerning), >15 (problematic)

- **Cognitive Complexity**: Measures how difficult code is to understand for humans.
  - *Interpretation*: Focuses on nested control flow, jumps, and logical operations.
  - *Thresholds*: 1-10 (good), 11-20 (moderate), 21-30 (concerning), >30 (problematic)

- **Method Length**: Counts lines of code in methods/functions.
  - *Interpretation*: Longer methods often try to do too much and should be refactored.
  - *Thresholds*: 1-30 (good), 31-50 (moderate), 51-100 (concerning), >100 (problematic)

- **Class Size**: Counts lines of code in classes.
  - *Interpretation*: Large classes often violate single responsibility principle.
  - *Thresholds*: 1-200 (good), 201-500 (moderate), 501-1000 (concerning), >1000 (problematic)

- **Inheritance Depth**: Measures the depth of inheritance hierarchies.
  - *Interpretation*: Deep inheritance can make code harder to understand and maintain.
  - *Thresholds*: 1-3 (good), 4-5 (moderate), 6-7 (concerning), >7 (problematic)

### 2. Performance Hotspots

The analyzer identifies potential performance hotspots based on:

- Functions with high cyclomatic complexity
- Long methods that may contain inefficient code
- Complex algorithms with both high cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
- Nested loops and inefficient data processing

### 3. Runtime Performance (when profiling is enabled)

- **Execution Time**: Measures how long functions take to execute
- **Function Call Count**: Counts how many times a function is called

## Visualizations

The performance visualization module can generate several visual reports:

1. **Complexity Charts**: Bar charts showing the complexity metrics of functions
2. **Hotspot Maps**: Visual representation of performance hotspots in the code
3. **Performance Dashboard**: Combined view of key performance indicators
4. **HTML Reports**: Interactive reports with all metrics and visualizations

## How to Use Performance Metrics

### For Code Reviews

1. **Identify Complex Functions**: Focus on functions with high complexity metrics
2. **Review Hotspots**: Prioritize review of identified performance hotspots
3. **Check Algorithm Efficiency**: Look for inefficient algorithms in complex areas
4. **Validate Resource Management**: Ensure resources are properly managed and released

### For Refactoring

1. **Simplify Complex Methods**: Break down methods with high complexity
2. **Extract Methods**: Split long methods into smaller, focused ones
3. **Optimize Hotspots**: Apply performance optimizations to identified hotspots
4. **Reduce Inheritance Depth**: Consider composition over inheritance where appropriate

## Example Usage

To analyze code for performance issues:

```python
from review_logic import CodeReviewer
from performance_metrics import RuntimePerformanceAnalyzer

# Initialize
reviewer = CodeReviewer()
analyzer = RuntimePerformanceAnalyzer()

# Analyze using the code reviewer
review_results = reviewer.review_code("my_file.py", template_type="performance")

# Get detailed metrics
performance_results = analyzer.analyze_code_file("my_file.py")

# Generate visualizations
from performance_visualization import PerformanceVisualizer
visualizer = PerformanceVisualizer(output_dir="reports")
visualizer.create_performance_dashboard(performance_results)
```

## Interpreting Reports

When reviewing a performance report:

1. **Look at Summary Metrics First**: Get a high-level view of the code's complexity
2. **Review Identified Issues**: Check specific issues the analyzer found
3. **Examine Hotspots**: Focus on the most critical areas first
4. **Consider Recommendations**: Evaluate the suggested improvements

## Performance Improvement Process

For systematic performance improvement:

1. **Measure**: Analyze the code with performance metrics
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on the most critical issues first
3. **Refactor**: Apply targeted refactoring to improve each hotspot
4. **Re-measure**: Analyze again to verify improvements
5. **Document**: Record the changes made and the improvements achieved

## Customizing Analysis

You can customize the analysis:

- Adjust complexity thresholds for your team's standards
- Add custom metrics specific to your codebase
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated performance checks

## Integration with Other Tools

The performance metrics can be integrated with:

- Static code analyzers
- Profilers
- Continuous integration systems
- Documentation generators
