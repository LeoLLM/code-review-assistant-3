# Security Review Template Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use the enhanced security review template for performing thorough security code reviews.

## Purpose of the Security Template

The security review template is designed to help reviewers conduct comprehensive security assessments of code by:

1. Providing a structured approach to security reviews
2. Ensuring common vulnerability categories are checked
3. Creating consistent, documented findings
4. Following industry best practices (OWASP, SANS, NIST)

## When to Use the Security Template

Use the security template when:

- Reviewing code that handles sensitive data
- Assessing authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Evaluating input handling and data validation
- Reviewing code with external dependencies
- Implementing cryptographic functionality
- Preparing for a formal security audit

## How to Use the Template

1. **Fill in the metadata section** with reviewer information, date, and scope
2. **Assess each category** using the checklist items
3. **Document specific findings** in the structured findings section
4. **Add recommendations** for each identified issue
5. **Provide risk ratings** based on severity and exploitability
6. **Include references** to standards or resources that provide more context

## Example Usage

### Quick Security Scan
For a quick security scan, focus on these critical sections:
- Input Validation & Data Sanitization
- Authentication & Authorization
- Data Protection & Privacy
- Dependency Security

### Comprehensive Review
For a comprehensive security review, complete all sections and provide detailed findings using the structured format.

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Include file names, line numbers, and code snippets when documenting issues
2. **Provide context** - Explain why something is a security concern
3. **Suggest fixes** - Include specific recommendations for addressing each issue
4. **Rate severity** - Use consistent risk ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
5. **Check for false positives** - Verify issues before reporting them

## Integration with Other Tools

The security template can be combined with automated security scanning tools:
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

Use the template to document and explain issues found by these tools.
